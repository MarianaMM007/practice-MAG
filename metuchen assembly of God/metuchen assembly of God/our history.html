        <h2>HISTORY OF METUCHEN ASSEMBLY OF GOD</h2>
        <p>November 27, 1966 was a memorable day for the Metuchen area!  The first Full Gospel meeting in that community was held in the YMCA with just 13 people in attendance. The late Rev. Norman Kirk and Rev. Paul Respass were Co-Pastors and as they worked together, the congregation grew.</p>
        <p>In November of 1969 after holding meetings in 7 locations, the church was able to purchase the present day property that was formerly the Lorraine Petroleum Power and Heating Company for $50,000. From its humble beginnings, construction on the sanctuary started in July of 1973 and was dedicated on June 9, 1974. District Superintendent Rev. John Paproski preached the dedication service.</p>
        <p>In 1972, Rev. Donald McFarren and his wife Cynthia joined the ministry team. For 8½ years, they oversaw the “Risen Son” coffee house and youth ministry. After suffering a stroke, Rev. Kirk became Pastor Emeritus and for a brief period Pastor Respass continued as the Senior Pastor and in 1982 Pastor Don became the Senior Pastor. We are truly grateful for the faithful leadership of Pastor Emeritus Don McFarren and his wife, Cindy who birthed and led the ministries of DaySpring Childcare Center (1983) and Metuchen Christian Academy (1986) for 35 years.</p>
        <p>The vision and mission of Metuchen Assembly of God continues to flourish under the leadership of Rev. Gregory McFarren and his wife, Dawn, who joined the ministry team in 1999 and served in various areas of ministry leading up to their current positions as lead pastors. Their ministry team consists of Principal Susan Howarth, Vice Principal Michelle Schettino, DaySpring Director Kimberly Harris, the Church Board of Directors, our wonderful faculty, staff, and dedicated volunteers. </p>
        <p><strong>To God be all the glory for the wonderful things He has done
        and going to do through His Church!</strong></p>
